# Stock App

An app for keeping track of sales, purchases and products in stock.

### For testing CRUD you can use the account below or request permissions from admin otherwise you will only have read only permissions:
Email : product@manager.com
Password : Product123.

### For backend I used Django. You can see documents here:
